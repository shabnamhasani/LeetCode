"""
Step 1: Iterate over the border (first/last row and first/last column)
For each 'O' on the border, mark all connected 'O's (using DFS/BFS) â€” e.g., change them to '#' temporarily.
Step 2: Go through the full board:
Convert remaining 'O's to 'X' (these are truly surrounded).
Convert '#'s back to 'O' (these were connected to the border)."""
